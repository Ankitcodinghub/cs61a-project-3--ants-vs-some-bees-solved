their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees’ wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games’ Plants Vs. Zombies (https://www.ea.com/studios/popcap /plants-vs-zombies).

This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on material from Chapter 2.5 (http://composingprograms.com/pages/25-object-oriented- programming.html) of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

Download starter �les

The ants.zip (ants.zip) archive contains several �les, but all of your changes will be

Logistics

This is a project. You may work with one other partner. You should not share your code with students who are not your partner or copy from anyone else’s solutions. In the end, you will submit one project for both partners. We strongly encourage you to use pair programming (/~cs61a/su21/articles/pair-programming) to work on all parts of the project together rather than splitting up the work. Whoever is not coding should contribute by looking at the code and providing comments on a direction to go and catching bugs.

The project is worth 27 points.

• 25 points are assigned for correctness

• 1 point for submitting Phase 1 by the �rst checkpoint date (July 23)

• 1 point for submitting Phases 1-3 by the second checkpoint date (July 27)

• 1 EC point for submitting the entire project by Thursday, July 29. • 2 EC points for submitting the extra credit problem, QueenAnt .

To receive all of the extra credit points for Ants, you must submit the full project and EC problem by the early submission deadline (July 29).

You will turn in the following �les: • ants.py

You do not need to modify or turn in any other �les to complete the project. To submit the project, run the following command:

<pre> python3 ok --submit
</pre>
You will be able to view your submissions on the Ok dashboard (http://ok.cs61a.org).

For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code, feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new function de�nitions as you see �t.

However, please do not modify any other functions. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of arguments).

Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code. It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems. However, you should not be testing too often, to allow yourself time to think through problems.

We have provided an autograder called ok to help you with testing your code and tracking your progress. The �rst time you run the autograder, you will be asked to log in with your Ok account using your web browser. Please do so. Each time you run ok , it will back up your work and progress on our servers.

The primary purpose of ok is to test your implementations.

We recommend that you submit after you �nish each problem. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission.

If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about your progress, you can run

<pre> python3 ok --local
</pre>
With this option, no information will be sent to our course servers. If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

python3 ok -q [question number] -i

with the appropriate question number (e.g. 01 ) inserted. This will run the tests for that

question until the �rst one you failed, then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.

You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre>  print("DEBUG:", x)
</pre>
which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail with extra output.

The Game

A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a di�erent action depending on their type, such as collecting more food or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of the tunnel (you lose), the bees destroy the

QueenAnt if it exists (you lose), or the entire bee �eet has been vanquished (you win).

Core concepts

The Colony. This is where the game takes place. The colony consists of several Place s that are chained together to form a tunnel where bees can travel through. The colony also has some quantity of food which can be expended in order to place an ant in a tunnel.

Places. A place links to another place to form a tunnel. The player can put a single ant into each place. However, there can be many bees in a single place.

The Hive. This is the place where bees originate. Bees exit the beehive to enter the ant colony.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Ants. Players place an ant into the colony by selecting from the available ant types at the top of the screen. Each type of ant takes a di�erent action and requires a di�erent amount of colony food to place. The two most basic ant types are the HarvesterAnt , which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the ThrowerAnt , which throws a leaf at a bee each turn. You will be implementing many more!

Bees. In this game, bees are the antagonistic forces that the player must defend the ant colony from. Each turn, a bee either advances to the next place in the tunnel if no ant is in its way, or it stings the ant in its way. Bees win when at least one bee reaches the end of a tunnel.

Core classes

The concepts described above each have a corresponding class that encapsulates the logic for that concept. Here is a summary of the main classes involved in this game:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
•

•

</div>
<div class="column">
GameState : Represents the colony and some state information about the game, including how much food is available, how much time has elapsed, where the

AntHomeBase is, and all the Place s in the game.

Place : Represents a single place that holds insects. At most one Ant can be in a single place, but there can be many Bee s in a single place. Place objects have an

exit to the left and an entrance to the right, which are also places. Bees travel through a tunnel by moving to a Place ‘s exit .

Hive : Represents the place where Bee s start out (on the right of the tunnel).

AntHomeBase : Represents the place Ant s are defending (on the left of the tunnel). If Bees get here, they win 🙁

Insect : A superclass for Ant and Bee . All insects have health attribute, representing their remaining health, and a place attribute, representing the

Place where they are currently located. Each turn, every active Insect in the game performs its action .

Ant : Represents ants. Each Ant subclass has special attributes or a special

action that distinguish it from other Ant types. For example, a HarvesterAnt gets food for the colony and a ThrowerAnt attacks Bee s. Each ant type also has a

food_cost attribute that indicates how much it costs to deploy one unit of that type of ant.

Bee : Represents bees. Each turn, a bee either moves to the exit of its current Place if the Place is not blocked by an ant, or stings the ant occupying its same Place .

Playing the game

The game can be run in two modes: as a text-based game or using a graphical user interface (GUI). The game logic is the same in either case, but the GUI enforces a turn time limit that makes playing the game more exciting. The text-based interface is provided for debugging and development.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The �les are separated according to these two modes. ants.py knows nothing of graphics or turn time limits.

To start a text-based game, run

<pre> python3 ants_text.py
</pre>
To start a graphical game, run

<pre> python3 gui.py
</pre>
When you start the graphical version, a new browser window should appear. In the starter implementation, you have unlimited food and your ants can only throw leaves at bees in their current Place . Before you complete Problem 2, the GUI may crash since it doesn’t have a full conception of what a Place is yet! Try playing the game anyway! You’ll need to place a lot of ThrowerAnt s (the second type) in order to keep the bees from reaching your queen.

The game has several options that you will use throughout the project, which you can view with python3 ants_text.py –help .

<pre> usage: ants_text.py [-h] [-d DIFFICULTY] [-w] [--food FOOD]

���What is the signi�cance of an Insect’s health attribute? Does this value change? If so, how?

���Which of the following is a class attribute of the Insect class?

���Is the health attribute of the Ant class an instance attribute or class attribute?

Why?

���Is the damage attribute of an Ant subclass (such as ThrowerAnt ) an instance

attribute or class attribute? Why?

���Which class do both Ant and Bee inherit from?

���What do instances of Ant and instances of Bee have in common?

���How many insects can be in a single Place at any given time (before Problem 8)? ���What does a Bee do during one of its turns?

Before writing any code, read the instructions and test your understanding of the problem:

Part A: Currently, there is no cost for placing any type of Ant , and so there is no challenge to the game. The base class Ant has a food_cost of zero. Override this class attribute for HarvesterAnt and ThrowerAnt according to the “Food Cost” column in the table below.

Part B: Now that placing an Ant costs food, we need to be able to gather more food! To �x this issue, implement the HarvesterAnt class. A HarvesterAnt is a type of Ant that adds one food to the gamestate.food total as its action .

After writing code, test your implementation:

<pre> python3 ok -q 01
</pre>
Try playing the game by running python3 gui.py . Once you have placed a HarvesterAnt , you should accumulate food each turn. You can also place ThrowerAnt s, but you’ll see that they can only attack bees that are in their Place , making it a little di�cult to win.

Right now, a Place keeps track only of its exit . We would like a Place to keep track of its entrance as well. A Place needs to track only one entrance . Tracking entrances will be useful when an Ant needs to see what Bee s are in front of it in the tunnel.

However, simply passing an entrance to a Place constructor will be problematic; we would need to have both the exit and the entrance before creating a Place ! (It’s a chicken or the egg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) problem.) To get around this problem, we will keep track of entrances in the following way instead.

Place.__init__ should use this logic:

• A newly created Place always starts with its entrance as None .

• If the Place has an exit , then the exit ‘s entrance is set to that Place .

In order for a ThrowerAnt to throw a leaf, it must know which bee to hit. The provided implementation of the nearest_bee method in the ThrowerAnt class only allows them to hit bees in the same Place . Your job is to �x it so that a ThrowerAnt will throw_at the nearest bee in front of it that is not still in the Hive . This includes bees that are in the same Place as a ThrowerAnt

Change nearest_bee so that it returns a random Bee from the nearest place that contains bees. Your implementation should follow this logic:

• Start from the current Place of the ThrowerAnt .

• For each place, return a random bee if there is any, and if not, inspect the place

in front of it (stored as the current place’s entrance ). • If there is no bee to attack, return None .

Phase 2: Ants!

Now that you’ve implemented basic gameplay with two types of Ant s, let’s add some �avor to the ways ants can attack bees. In this phase, you’ll be implementing several di�erent Ant s with di�erent attack strategies.

After you implement each Ant subclass in this section, you’ll need to set its implemented class attribute to True so that that type of ant will show up in the GUI.

Feel free to try out the game with each new ant to test the functionality!

With your Phase 2 ants, try python3 gui.py -d easy to play against a full swarm of bees in a multi-tunnel layout and try -d normal , -d hard , or -d extra-hard if you want a real challenge! If the bees are too numerous to vanquish, you might need to create some new ants.

Problem 4 (3 pt)

Before writing any code, read the instructions and test your understanding of the problem:

<pre> python3 ok -q 04 -u
</pre>
A ThrowerAnt is a powerful threat to the bees, but it has a high food cost. In this problem, you’ll implement two subclasses of ThrowerAnt that are less costly but have constraints on the distance they can throw:

• The LongThrower can only throw_at a Bee that is found after following at least 5 entrance transitions. It cannot hit Bee s that are in the same Place as it or the

�rst 4 Place s in front of it. If there are two Bees , one too close to the LongThrower and the other within its range, the LongThrower should only throw at

the farther Bee , which is within its range, instead of trying to hit the closer Bee . • The ShortThrower can only throw_at a Bee that is found after following at most 3 entrance transitions. It cannot throw at any ants further than 3 Place s in front of

it.

Neither of these specialized throwers can throw_at a Bee that is exactly 4 Place s away.

To implement these new throwing ants, your ShortThrower and LongThrower classes should inherit the nearest_bee method from the base ThrowerAnt class. The logic of choosing which bee a thrower ant will attack is the same, except the ShortThrower and

LongThrower ants have a maximum and minimum range, respectively.

To do this, modify the nearest_bee method to reference min_range and max_range

attributes, and only return a bee if it is within range.

Make sure to give these min_range and max_range appropriate values in ThrowerAnt so that the behavior of ThrowerAnt is unchanged. Then, implement the subclasses

LongThrower and ShortThrower with appropriately constrained ranges. You should not need to repeat any code between ThrowerAnt , ShortThrower , and LongThrower .

Implement the FireAnt , which does damage when it receives damage. Speci�cally, if it is damaged by amount health units, it does a damage of amount to all bees in its place (this is called re�ected damage). If it dies, it does an additional amount of damage, as speci�ed by its damage attribute.

To implement this, override FireAnt ‘s reduce_health method. Your overriden method should call the reduce_health method inherited from Ant , which is itself inherited from Insect to reduce the current FireAnt instance’s health. That base reduce_health method reduces the insect’s health by the given amount and removes the insect from its place if health reaches zero or lower.

However, your method needs to also include the re�ective damage logic:

• Determine the re�ective damage amount: start with the amount in�icted on the ant, and then add damage if the ant’s health has dropped to 0.

• For each bee in the place, damage them with the total amount by calling the

directly reference this attribute name.

Also, give each HungryAnt an instance attribute chew_countdown that counts the number of turns it has left to chew (initialized to 0, since it hasn’t eaten anything at the beginning. You can also think of

chew_countdown as the number of turns until a HungryAnt can eat another Bee ).

Implement the action method of the HungryAnt : First, check if it is chewing; if so, decrement its chew_countdown . Otherwise, eat a random Bee in its place by reducing the Bee ‘s health to 0. Make sure to set the chew_countdown when a Bee is eaten!

Right now, our ants are quite frail. We’d like to provide a way to help them last longer against the onslaught of the bees. Enter the BodyguardAnt .

A BodyguardAnt di�ers from a normal ant because it is a ContainerAnt ; it can contain another ant and protect it, all in one Place . When a Bee stings the ant in a Place where one ant contains another, only the container is damaged. The ant inside the container can still perform its original action. If the container perishes, the contained ant still remains in the place (and can then be damaged).

Each ContainerAnt has an instance attribute ant_contained that stores the ant it contains. This ant, ant_contained , initially starts o� as None to indicate that there is no

ant being stored yet. Implement the store_ant method so that it sets the ContainerAnt ‘s ant_contained instance attribute to the passed in ant argument. Also

implement the ContainerAnt ‘s action method to perform its ant_contained ‘s action if it is currently containing an ant.

In addition, you will need to make the following modi�cations throughout your program so that a container and its contained ant can both occupy a place at the same time (a maximum of two ants per place), but only if exactly one is a container:

���There is an Ant.can_contain method, but it always returns False . Override the method ContainerAnt.can_contain so that it takes an ant other as an argument and returns True if:

◦ This ContainerAnt does not already contain another ant.

◦ The other ant is not a container.

���Modify Ant.add_to to allow a container and a non-container ant to occupy the

same place according to the following rules:

<ul>
<li>If the ant originally occupying a place can contain the ant being added, thenboth ants occupy the place and original ant contains the ant being added.</li>
<li>If the ant being added can contain the ant originally in the space, then bothants occupy the place and the (container) ant being added contains theoriginal ant.</li>
<li>If neither Ant can contain the other, raise the same AssertionError asbefore (the one already present in the starter code).

Hint: You may �nd the is_container attribute that each Ant has useful for checking if a speci�c Ant is a container. You should also take advantage of the

can_contain method you wrote and avoid repeating code.

The constructor of ContainerAnt.__init__ is implemented as follows:

def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): Ant.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs) self.ant_contained = None

As we saw in Hog, args is bound to all positional arguments (which are all arguments passed without keywords), and kwargs is bound to all the keyword arguments. This ensures that both sets of arguments are passed to the Ant constructor.

E�ectively, this means the constructor is exactly the same as Ant.__init__ but sets self.ant_contained = None

Phase 4: Water and Might

In the �nal phase, you’re going to add one last kick to the game by introducing a new type of place and new ants that are able to occupy this place. One of these ants is the most important ant of them all: the queen of the colony (although the game is completely playable without the queen ant, as it is extra credit).

Let’s add water to the colony! Currently there are only two types of places, the Hive and a basic Place . To make things more interesting, we’re going to create a new type of Place called Water.

Only an insect that is waterproof can be placed in Water . In order to determine whether an Insect is waterproof, add a new class attribute to the Insect class named

is_waterproof that is set to False . Since bees can �y, set their is_waterproof attribute to True , overriding the inherited value.

Now, implement the add_insect method for Water . First, add the insect to the place regardless of whether it is waterproof. Then, if the insect is not waterproof, reduce the insect’s health to 0. Do not repeat code from elsewhere in the program. Instead, use methods that have already been de�ned.

Finally, implement the QueenAnt . The queen is a waterproof ScubaThrower that inspires her fellow ants through her bravery. In addition to the standard ScubaThrower action, the QueenAnt doubles the damage of all the ants behind her each time she performs an action. Once an ant’s damage has been doubled, it is not doubled again for subsequent turns.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. The QueenAnt is governed by three special rules:

���If the queen ever has its health reduced to 0, the bees win. The bees also still win if any bee reaches the end of a tunnel. You can call bees_win() to signal to the simulator that the game is over.

���There can be only one true queen. Any queen instantiated beyond the �rst one is an impostor, and should have its health reduced to 0 upon taking its �rst action, without doubling any ant’s damage or throwing anything. If an impostor dies, the game should still continue as normal.

���The true (�rst) queen cannot be removed. Attempts to remove the queen should have no e�ect (but should not cause an error). You will need to override

Ant.remove_from in QueenAnt to enforce this condition.

Optional Problems

Optional Problem 1

Before writing any code, read the instructions and test your understanding of the problem:

python3 ok -q optional1 -u

Implement the NinjaAnt , which damages all Bee s that pass by, but can never be

stung.

A NinjaAnt does not block the path of a Bee that �ies by. To implement this behavior, �rst modify the Ant class to include a new class attribute blocks_path that is set to

True , then override the value of blocks_path to False in the NinjaAnt class.

Second, modify the Bee ‘s method blocked to return False if either there is no Ant in the Bee ‘s place or if there is an Ant , but its blocks_path attribute is False . Now

Finally, we want to make the NinjaAnt damage all Bee s that �y past. Implement the action method in NinjaAnt to reduce the health of all Bee s in the same place as the NinjaAnt by its damage attribute. Similar to the FireAnt , you must iterate over a

potentially changing list of bees.

After writing code, test your implementation:

python3 ok -q optional1

For a challenge, try to win a game using only HarvesterAnt and NinjaAnt .

Optional Problem 2

Before writing any code, read the instructions and test your understanding of the problem:

<pre> python3 ok -q optional2 -u
</pre>
Implement two �nal thrower ants that do zero damage, but instead apoly a temporary “status” on the action method of a Bee instance that they throw_at . This status is an action (a function taking a GameState parameter) that temporarily replaces the current action. This replacement action lasts for a certain number of calls upon it, after which subsequent calls simply invoke the previous action (the action that was present when the status was applied.)

We will be implementing two new ants that inherit from ThrowerAnt .

• SlowThrower throws sticky syrup at a bee, applying a slow status for 3 calls. • ScaryThrower intimidates a nearby bee, causing it to back away instead of

advancing. (If the bee is already right next to the Hive and cannot go back further, it should not move. To check if a bee is next to the Hive, you might �nd the

is_hive instance attribute of Place s useful). The scare status lasts for 2 turns. Once a bee has been scared once, it can’t be scared ever again.

In order to complete the implementations of these two ants, you will need to set their class attributes appropriately and implement the following three methods on Bee s:

��� slow applies a status that calls the previous action (the one in e�ect when the status is applied) on every turn that gamestate.time is even and does nothing on other turns.

��� scare applies a status that makes the bee go backwards. It does nothing on a Bee that has previously been scared.

��� apply_status is an internal method on Bee s that is used by slow and scare to

takes a status (as described above) and a length and replace the current .action method (which may itself be a previously applied status) with the new

status for length calls upon it.

In order to implement apply_status , it is helpful to use nonlocal . You can read section 2.4.4 (https://composingprograms.com/pages/24-mutable-data.html#local-state) of the textbook or watch the �rst few videos from this playlist (https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=w1TQ0yd8pG0&amp;list=PL6BsET-8jgYV8OB50APxdaDQgfhVC8rWi&amp;index=2) to learn about nonlocal and how it is used.

Hint: to make a bee go backwards, consider adding an instance attribute indicating its current direction. Where should you change the bee’s direction? Once the direction is known, how can you modify the action method of Bee to move appropriately?

Hint: You will need to assign a function to a method in one of the functions. The function you assign does not include a self parameter.

class X:

def f(self, x): return x

def f(x): return x ** 3 x = X()

x.f = f

print(x.f(2)) # prints 8

Take the example of a bee that has been slowed twice (say by two separate SlowThrower s). It will have the following behavior:

<ul>
<li>On time 1, the bee will do nothing. The second slow now has 2 turns to go; the �rst one still has 3 turns (since it will not have been called).</li>
<li>On time 2, the bee moves forward. The second slow has 1 turn to go; the �rst one has 2 turns.</li>
<li>On time 3, the bee will do nothing. The second slow has no turns left; the �rst one has 2 turns.</li>
<li>On time 4, the bee moves forward. The �rst slow has 1 turn left.</li>
<li>On time 5, the bee does nothing. The �rst slow has no turns left.</li>

You can run some provided tests, but they are not exhaustive:

Make sure to test your code! Your code should be able to apply multiple statuses on a target; each new status applies to the current (possibly previously a�ected) action method of the bee.

Optional Problem 3

We’ve been developing this ant for a long time in secret. It’s so dangerous that we had to lock it in the super hidden CS61A underground vault, but we �nally think it is ready to go out on the �eld. In this problem, you’ll be implementing the �nal ant —

LaserAnt , a ThrowerAnt with a twist.

The LaserAnt shoots out a powerful laser, damaging all that dare to stand in its path. Both Bee s and Ant s, of all types, are at risk of being damaged by LaserAnt . When a

LaserAnt takes its action, it will damage all Insect s in its place (excluding itself, but including its container if it has one) and the Place s in front of it, excluding the Hive .

If that were it, LaserAnt would be too powerful for us to contain. The LaserAnt has a base damage of 2 . But, LaserAnt ‘s laser comes with some quirks. The laser is weakened by 0.25 each place it travels away from LaserAnt ‘s place. Additionally,

LaserAnt has limited battery. Each time LaserAnt actually damages an Insect its laser’s total damage goes down by 0.0625 (1/16). If LaserAnt ‘s damage becomes negative due to these restrictions, it simply does 0 damage instead.

The exact order in which things are damaged within a turn is unspeci�ed.

In order to complete the implementation of this ultimate ant, read through the LaserAnt class, set the class attributes appropriately, and implement the following two

functions:

��� insects_in_front is an instance method, called by the action method, that takes in beehive (the current Hive ), and returns a dictionary where each key is an

Insect and each corresponding value is the distance (in places) that that Insect is away from LaserAnt . The dictionary should include all Insects on the same place or in front of the LaserAnt , excluding LaserAnt itself.

��� calculate_damage is an instance method that takes in distance , the distance that an insect is away from the LaserAnt instance. It returns the damage that the

class or instance attributes in the LaserAnt class as needed. You can run the provided sanity test, but it is not exhaustive:
